Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated
with patient survey responses?

For this question, I was unable to join the measures from the hospital scores
to the measures from the survey ratings as they are not related.  However, I
could join the provider_ids from the two tables in order to create a pairwise
table of the average hospital quality scores and the average survey star
ratings per hospital.  I then took the Pearson's correlation of these two
metrics and returned -0.27.

It appears the quality scores for hospitals as measured by time and
effectiveness is slightly negatively correlated with patient satisfaction
ratings.  I am not surprised by this result as I have read that customer
satisfaction in hospital settings is often at odds with clinical
effectiveness.
